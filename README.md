# Probabilistic Chatbot
This is a (finally, it's successful!) full fledged symbolic Bayesian chatbot that is (sorta) capable of learning in few shots (each category contains 5 data samples) and can handle misspelt words. The intent classification is trained using a Naive Bayes model, whereas the actual chatbot is completely symbolic. Right now, the intent classification can only handle simple questions. In the future (if I have time and willpower), I will try replacing this intent classification model with a stronger model (maybe Bayesian Program Learning / Synthesis would be a good start, like [Gamalon](https://gamalon.com/)).
